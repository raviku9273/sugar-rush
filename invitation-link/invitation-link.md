# Invitation Link

For obvious reasons, this resource has been moved elsewhere. You can access it via this link.

```
tiny.cc/password
```

You need to replace `password` with a 12 letter-word, which is formed by concatenating 3 words.

* **Word-1** : A 7 letter word which is open 24-hours during the examination period.
* **Word-2** : A 3 letter word which is open 24-hours during the examination period and is located right next to the first answer.
* **Word-3** : A 2 letter word which is open 24-hours during the examination period.

Once you access the link, you'll find 2 files by the name `invitation-link.md` and `invitation-link.html`. You need to download `invitation-link.html` and view it in your browser.

**Tip** : You should try to give virtual-contests rather than offline-solving (as there are already tons of questions to practice on **LeetCode**).
