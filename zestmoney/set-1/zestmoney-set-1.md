* **Important Note** : Before you read further, you might want to [enable syntax highlighting](../../documentation/documentation.md). Without it, the linked codes would be almost unreadable. Moreover, the instructions are different from last time (as I found an easier way to retain **Github flavoured syntax highlighting**).

# Stress Testing for Dummies
The best way to learn is by debugging your incorrect solution. However, that might be too difficult for large test-cases.

# Editorial

I'd like to thank [aqu106](https://github.com/aqu106) for setting up the problem page on Polygon and [lavish315](https://codeforces.com/profile/lavish315) for testing the questions and proposing the second version for **Segment Query** after spotting the precision issue in my initial solution. So, if you get a **WA** on TC-254/255, you know who to blame :)
