**Important Note** : Before you read further, you might want to [enable syntax highlighting](../../documentation/documentation.md). Without it, the linked codes would be almost unreadable. Moreover, the instructions are different from last time (as I found an easier way to retain **Github flavoured syntax highlighting**).


I'd like to thank **Deepankur Gupta** for guiding me to the initial solution and **Siddhartha Srivastava** ( [gravito12345](https://codeforces.com/profile/gravito12345) ) for providing an alternate implementation to test the round.
