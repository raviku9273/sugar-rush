# Editorial

I'd like to thank [aqu106](https://github.com/aqu106) for setting up the problem page on Polygon and [lavish315](https://codeforces.com/profile/lavish315) for testing the questions at such short notice. Also, thanks to [gravito12345](http://codeforces.com/profile/gravito12345) for providing the solution to  **Opening Hospitals**. If not for him, the question wouldn't have been in the problemset (as I had misinterpreted the question earlier).


This was one of my favourite rounds. The questions were interesting!

* [Activate Fountain](activate-fountain/activate-fountain.md)
* [Shortest Substring](shortest-substring/shortest-substring.md)
* [Opening Hospitals](opening-hospitals/opening-hospitals.md)
* [Maximum Common Candies](maximum-common-candies/maximum-common-candies.md)
